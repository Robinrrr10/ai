Intro about this notes:
----------------------
This notes has short and sweet notes of ML and sklearn

For complete detailed notes please refer below

This ml_and_sk_learn_notes.txt I have written post learning machine learning



Machine Learning
----------------
Machine learning is the technique where we can create a model and train with set of datas and use that for predicting answer
sklearn is the library in python used for this.
We can create a model, then train it and use for prediction


Regression and Classification
----------------------------

Machine learning solves two types of problem

1. Regression - For solving numeric values.
2. Classification - For solving answers for given choice 

Regression::
This deals with numberic values.
Its for predicting number values
Here the answer will be number
Eg:
Price of house
Height of bridge
length of items



Classification::
This deals with given options
Machine needs to predict answers from the given options
Here the answer will be one of the given choise
Eg:
yes or no
Low, medium or high
predicting blood group
Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E


------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 types of category on machine learning algothirm
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Supervised learning: Here we already know the given columns(feature names)
2. Unsupervised learning: Here we don't know the columns(feature names). we have to find that
3. Reinforcement learning:
