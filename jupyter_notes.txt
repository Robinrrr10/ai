x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)  # 100 values from 0 to 2Ï€
y = np.sin(x)  # Compute sine of each x value

# Create the plot
plt.plot(x, y, label='Sine Wave', color='blue')

# Add labels and title
plt.title("Sine Wave Example")
plt.xlabel("x (radians)")
plt.ylabel("sin(x)")
plt.legend()

# Show grid and plot
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Cloud:
-----
There are few cloud platform which gives similar to jupyter.
Those are below 2
google colab
